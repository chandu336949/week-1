Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images Using Deep Learning
Overview
Pneumonia remains a leading cause of illness and mortality worldwide, especially in children and elderly patients. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, providing a fast, reliable, and scalable solution to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals.

Problem Statement
Develop an AI model that can classify chest X-rays into Pneumonia or Normal categories with high accuracy, enabling automated screening and early diagnosis to save lives.

Dataset
Source: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle

Details: Over 5,800 labeled X-ray images of pneumonia and healthy lungs.

Split: Training, validation, and test sets for robust model assessment.

Approach
Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn complex visual patterns in X-ray images.

Perform data preprocessing including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model robustness.

Train, validate, and fine-tune the model to maximize detection accuracy.

Evaluate model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Implement visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) for model interpretability and trustworthiness.

Tools & Technologies
Python, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning.

Jupyter Notebook for interactive development.

GPU acceleration for faster training.

Impact
This AI-driven solution promises to:

Accelerate pneumonia diagnosis workflows.

Reduce the burden on radiologists.

Improve patient outcomes through early detection.

Serve as a foundation for AI applications in medical imaging.
