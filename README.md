Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Images 
Overview:
Pneumonia remains a leading cause of illness and mortality worldwide, especially in children and elderly patients. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective treatment. This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images, providing a fast, reliable, and scalable solution to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals.

Problem Statement:
Develop an AI model that can classify chest X-rays into Pneumonia or Normal categories with high accuracy, enabling automated screening and early diagnosis to save lives.

Dataset:
1.Source: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle

2.Details: Over 5,800 labeled X-ray images of pneumonia and healthy lungs.

3.Split: Training, validation, and test sets for robust model assessment.

Approach"
1.Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn complex visual patterns in X-ray images.

2.Perform data preprocessing including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model robustness.

3.Train, validate, and fine-tune the model to maximize detection accuracy.

4.Evaluate model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5.Implement visualization techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) for model interpretability and trustworthiness.

Tools & Technologies:
1.Python, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning.

2.Jupyter Notebook for interactive development.

3.GPU acceleration for faster training.

Impact:
1.This AI-driven solution promises to:
